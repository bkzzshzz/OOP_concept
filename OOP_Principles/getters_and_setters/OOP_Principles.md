# Encapsulation

### Binding all the data members and methods into a single unit. 


# Abstraction

### That only shows the necessary information and hides unnecessary information. Making private methods in main class.

# Inheritance

### That allows us to reuse code throughout.

# Polymorphism

### How the same entity can be used for many purposes.
